add search patterns:

<field name="name" string="Student Name" filter_domain="['|', ('name', 'ilike', self), ('last_name', 'ilike', self)]"

string - the way it will be displayed at client side.
name - name of the field in model side.
filter_domain - the filter that you want your field to have on search





add custom filters:

<filter string="RollNumbers" name="roll_number" domain="[('roll_number', '!=', False)]" />

string - the way it will be displayed at client side.
name - field name in model side.
domain - which roll_number records you wish to return.

by doing that, you will add a permanently filter on your filter option.

to use and condition on search, the second parameter has to be set as 'is set' by going in 'add custom filter'.







add group by filter:

<group> string="Group By">
	<filter name="school_id" string="School" context="{'group_by':'school_id'}"/>
</group>


that way we can add a group by filter by default in group by options.








how to add a search panel:

we are only able to define either selection or relation field.

<searchpanel>
	<field name="school_id" select="multi" enable_counters="1"/>
</searchpanel>

name - field name.
select - able to select multiples options at once.
enable_counters - counts how many records the category has.






dynamic filter based on date time and day related filter:


<filter string="create_date" name="Create Date" domain="[('create_date', '>=', context_today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))]" />

<filter string="create_date" name="Create Date" domain="[('create_date', '>=', (context_today() + datetime.timedelta(-6)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))]" />
