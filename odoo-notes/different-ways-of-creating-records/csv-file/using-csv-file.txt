to create a csv file having multiples models on a module, you have to refer the model's name in csv file:

res.partner.csv

structure:

street,street_one,city,state,country,zip_code #those are model's attributes.#


real scenario:



.py file:

class Hobbies(models.Model):
	_name = "hobbies"
	
	name = fields.Char(
		string = "Hobby"
	)
	
	
csv file:

name: hobby.csv # if it has the wrong model name mencion, it will raise an error

structure:

id,name # id has to be unique
hobby_1,"Hobby1" 
hobby_2,"Hobby2"
hobby_3,"Hobby3"
hobby_4,"Hobby4"

if you change the record's name, when updating csv file, it will only update changed attribute.




with many2one field:

csv file:

school.profile.cvs

id,name,school_number
school_1,"CSV School Name","10"



csv file:

school.student.csv

id,name,school_id:id,total_fees
student_1,"Student Name",school_1,6000



with one2many field:

csv file:

csv file:

school.student.csv

id,name,school_id:id,total_fees
student_1,"Student Name",school_1,6000 # only refers which id you are using, that way one2many field will populate by it self.



with many2many field:


csv file:

name: hobby.csv

structure:

id,name 
hobby_1,"Hobby1" 
hobby_2,"Hobby2"
hobby_3,"Hobby3"
hobby_4,"Hobby4"


csv file:

school.student.csv

id,name,school_id:id,total_fees,hobby_list:id
student_1,"Student Name",school_1,6000,"hobby_1,hobby_2,hobby_3"
