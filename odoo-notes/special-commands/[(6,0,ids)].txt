(6, 0, ids): refering many2many fields

it is used to add a field in a many2many relation and to take it out of it too.


def button_command_6(self):
	self.write({'hobby_list': [(6, 0, ,[(1,2,3)])]}) #  that way, we are going to add those ids in hobby list
	

def button_command_6(self):
	self.write({'hobby_list': [(6, 0, ,[(1)])]}) #  that way, we are going to remove this id from hobby list, if he was already at it
	
	
we cannot create a record using this command, only refer an existing one.
