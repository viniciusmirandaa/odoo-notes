create a model with field from both models.



add both models on manifest depends list.

on model side:

class StudentSchoolDynamicView(models.Model):
	_name = "student.school.dynamic.view"
	_auto = False
	
	school_name = field.Char("School Name")
	school_phone = field.Char("School Phone")
	school_email = field.Char("School Email")
	school_type = field.Selection(
			string = "School Name",
			selection = 
			[
				('public', 'Public School'),
				('private', 'Private School')
			]
	)
	
	student_name = fields.Char("Student Name")
	student_email = fields.Char("Student Email")
	student_rno = fields.Char("Student Roll Number")
	student_fees = fields.Float("Student Fees")
	
	def int(self):
		tools.drop_view_if_exists(self.env.cr, self._table)
		self.env.cr.execute("""
		create or replace view {} as (
			select std.id, 
			std.roll_number as student_rno, 
			std.name asstudent_name,  
			sp.name as school_name,
			sp.email as school_email,
			sp.phone as school_phone,
			sp.school_type as school_type
			std.student_fees as student_fees 
			from school_student as std join school_profile as sp
			on std.school_id = sp.id)
		""")
	
	
	
on xml side:

<odoo>
	<record id="dynamic_student_list_view" model="ir.ui.view">
		<field name="name">dynamic.student.list.view</field>
		<field name="model">student.school.dynamic.view</field>
		<field name="arch" type="xml">
			<field name="school_name"/>
			<field name="school_phone"/>
			<field name="school_email"/>
			<field name="school_type"/>
			<field name="student_name"/>
			<field name="student_email"/>
			<field name="student_rno"/>
			<field name="student_fees"/>
		</field>
	</record>
</odoo>
