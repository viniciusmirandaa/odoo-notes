first way:

_inherit different model from the original one. By doing some changes, it will be changed at the original too.

school_student model: 

name;
school_id;
age;
fees;



at another model create a inheritance related to school_student to add new fields to it.

school_extended model:

_inherit = 'school_student'

student_full_name;



school_student model now:

name;
school_id;
age;
fees;
student_full_name;



xml way:

<record model="ir.ui.view" id="school_student.form">
	<field name="name">school_student form</field>
	<field name="model">school.student</field>
	<field name="inherit_id" ref="module_name.form_name"/>
	<field name="arch" type="xml">
		<field name="name" position="after">
			<field name="student_full_name"/>
		</field>
	</field>
</record>




second way: 

if want to reuse some fields that are in another model, tou can simply _inherit this model for that.


class Adress(models.Model): # model that we want to reuse
	_name = "address"
	_rec_name = "street"
	
	fields:
	street;
	street_one;
	city;
	state;
	country;
	zip_code;
	


class school_student(models_Model):
	_name="school.student"
	_inherit="address"
	
	school_student field...
	

that way you have access to both models fields. Allowing you to put them in xml file too.




third way:


by using _inherits u can use multiple inheritance and extend object fields and methods.
