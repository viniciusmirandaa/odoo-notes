how to delete views/menus/actions using delete tag:

record:

<record id="student_2" model="school.student">
	<field name="name">Student Name</field>
	<field name="total_fees">290</field>
	<field name="school_id" ref="school.school_2"/>
	<field name="school_id" eval="[(6, 0, [ref(hobby_1), ref(hobby_2)])]"/>
</record>

xml file:

delete_date.xml

content:

<odoo>	
	<delete id="student_2" model="school.student"/> # target's id and model 
</odoo>

if id it is from another model, we have to specify in id value, "school.school_1"



menu:


<odoo>	
	<delete id="menu_name" model="ir.ui.menu"/> # target's id and model 
</odoo>
